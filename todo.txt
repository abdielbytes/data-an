If your selected dataset does not include longitude and latitude values for each polling unit or ward, use geocoding techniques to obtain them.

first read the file. 
go the pu-name column and use and api to loop through and find their longitude and latitude values.
in each interation add a column for longitude and anither for latitude after the pu-name on the csv file.

Neighbour Identification:
Identify neighbouring polling units based on geographical proximity. Define a radius (e.g., 1 km) to determine which units are considered neighbours.
Outlier Score Calculation:
For each polling unit, compare the votes each party received with those of its neighbouring units.
Calculate an outlier score for each party based on the deviation of votes from neighbouring units.
Record the outlier scores along with the respective parties and neighbouring units.
Sorting and Reporting:
Sort the dataset by the outlier scores for each party to identify the most significant outliers.
Provide a detailed report explaining the methodology and findings.
Highlight the top 3 outliers and their closest polling units, explaining why they are considered outliers.
